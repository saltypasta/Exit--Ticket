## *This course will enable you to analyze and assess historical documents, artifacts, and other primary sources through the lens of digital history methods, critically applied, and you will develop awareness of the ways digital tools change what it is possible to know about the past.*

I believe I have performed well in this area. Throughout my work I jotted down ideas in both my reflection and log files about the connections I made with digital history methods and historical analysis. For example, while working with R I wrote “Immediately the power of these tools is obvious. being able to sort through large amounts of data and present it in meaningful contexts to answer or ask historical questions is awesome.” While completing the exercises for any given module, I was not simply following the steps blindly. I actively considered how these tools could benefit historical analyses I had done in the past, as well as future projects. 8/10

## *At the same time, this ability will enable you to analyze and assess critically digital tools and methods from a historical perspective.*

This is something that I was very conscious about from day 1 of the class. In my first reflection, I concluded with
“Amalia S. Levi had some really interesting points about the gaps in digital archives and what they mean. These gaps exist because digitization is selective. Sometimes archivists decide something is not relevant or important, or it is too fragile to be digitized, or the item simply is not searchable as it was not described at the item-level. It’s worth keeping these things in mind for when I use digital archives in the future so I have a better understanding of the limits of digital archives.”
While using Voyant one of my key takeaways was
“As usual, it's important to keep in mind how your methods of arriving to these insights…”.
I was always conscious of the limitations of the digital tools we used, and wrote about them frequently throughout the modules. 10/10

## *Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital historians collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion.*

This section was perhaps one of the most difficult for me. In past courses, I often did my work and studying independently with minimal collaboration with my peers unless required. That being said, I was aware that this was a part of the learning outcomes and that the course was clearly designed to foster collaboration and communication. I made a conscious effort to keep up with the class discord, and answer/react/ask questions where appropriate to demonstrate my engagement. Although at first my intentions were to meet the learning outcome, I began to enjoy talking and joking about the material we were engaging with. I didn’t find I often had much to contribute technically, but I did share a piece of software that is useful for blocking blue light and developing healthy computer usage habits (F.lux). I also mentioned in my logs that I was grateful for the discord chat as it helped me resolve several issues, and thus I could appreciate the value of collaboration instead of working in a vacuum. 10/10

## *Another outcome will be the ability to translate the results of digital methods into historical argument.*

I believe I did an acceptable job forming arguments using digital methods. There were a couple sections I could have called upon more course readings to justify my position, however my core arguments using digital tools were well supported. 7.5/10

## *Digital work is often necessarily therefore a kind of public work, and a final outcome therefore will be a professionalized presence online.*

I believe my work was acceptably professional given the timeline, as well as the informal nature of the course. Although I was susceptible to using informal language at times (Especially in the beginning of the course) I still cited sources correctly and made use of provided feedback to improve the overall professionalism of my work. 7.5/10


Comparing my work against the learning outcomes, my self-assessment yields a score of 43/50 or 86%. Beyond the learning outcomes, this course has given me an appreciation for digital history and its applications. I have learned the value of not only several new digital tools, but also the value of collaboration. Lastly, at the beginning of the course we were told that we were expected to challenge ourselves. I decided to follow the newcomer’s sequence in the beginning as I have minimal experience with most of the tools we learned. It would have been acceptable for me to only complete the required materials for that sequence, however in week 3 I chose to explore the story maps tool in addition to my required materials. Though I did not find it to be a technically challenging tool, I wanted to make that effort to challenge myself beyond the newcomer’s sequence. For these reasons, I feel that an 85% or A is a reasonable grade based on my growth and performance through the course. Of course, I respect your judgement completely, and I very much enjoyed learning from you. See you in HIST 3000!
